Although they have some constraints (as any real product), feel free to add new features and to be as creative as you want. If you have questions, representatives from the nonprofits will be available to answer them during the hackathon. <br>If you are interested in creating something for this track other than the nonprofit projects, don't worry! We have also added example projects to inspire you to develop some great civic tech.</p>

We provide dozens of tools to the New Haven community for them to build and develop projects for their communities or for themselves. In addition, we host several workshops that range from simple clothing repair, to 3D modeling, and all the way to creating a business from a prototype.</td>

								<td> MakeHaven wants to automate the following processes through a Slackbot:
									<ol>
										<li>Provide a link to an online waver (you can use a link to MakeHaven as a placeholder).</li>
										<li>Watch orientation videos (found on YouTube, you can put your favorite videos as placeholders).
										<li>Sign up for Slack Community</li>
										<li>Schedule key pickup</li>
										<li>Identify area of interest (3D printing, laser cutting, woodworking).</li>
										<li> Watch tool orientation video (also found on YouTube).</li>
										<li>Schedule meeting with volunteer coordinator for tool to be approved for use.</li>
									</ol>
									Once the new member has been approved to use the tool, the Slackbot should remind the member about other tools available, and about their respective orientations. If possible, after 30, and 60 days, the Slackbot could check in if everything is okay, and suggest orientations for other tools. 
									<br>
									This description is very broad on purpose. There will be people who will answer any questions you may have at the hackathon, but remember that this will actually be used and modified by people. Therefore, try to make it as versatile, general, and easy-to-use as possible.

In both communities we work to build local leadership and capacity and address root causes of poverty and injustice.</td>
